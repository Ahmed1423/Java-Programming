A marker Interface is an empty interface that has no fields or methods.

A marker interface is a special type of interface because it does not have any methods, so when a class implements a marker interface, it means it is giving a signal to Java that this class should be treated differently.

Example: 

1. Serializable Interface
2. Cloneable Interface
