ðŸ§ª Shallow Copy
âœ… Definition:
A shallow copy duplicates the top-level object, but does not clone nested objects. It copies references â€” not the actual objects they point to.

ðŸ§  Behavior:
Primitive fields â†’ copied by value

Object fields â†’ copied by reference


class Address {
    String city;
}

class Student implements Cloneable {
    String name;
    Address address;

    public Student(String name, Address address) {
        this.name = name;
        this.address = address;
    }

    @Override
    protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // shallow copy
    }
}



ðŸ§¬ Deep Copy
âœ… Definition:
A deep copy duplicates the object and recursively clones all nested objects. Each field is independently copied.

@Override
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
    Student cloned = (Student) super.clone();
    cloned.address = new Address(); // or address.clone() if Address is Cloneable
    cloned.address.city = this.address.city;
    return cloned;
}
