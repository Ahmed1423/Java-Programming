The for loop is used when you know in advance how many times you want to execute a statement or block of statements.
It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

Initialization: Sets the starting point of the loop.
Condition: Determines whether the loop continues executing.
Increment/Decrement: Updates the loop control variable.


for(int i = 1; i <= 10; ++i) {
  System.out.print(i + " ");
}
