The for-each loop is a simplified version of the for loop, designed for iterating over arrays or collections. It's useful when you want
to iterate through all elements of a collection without needing the index.

This is also called as enhanced for loop


for (type element : collection) {
    // Code to be executed for each element
}


String [] names = {"Ahmed", "Anwar", "Mukarram", "Amer"}

for(String name: names) {
  System.out.println(name);
}
