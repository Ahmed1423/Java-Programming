The while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and you want to repeat a
block of code while a condition is true


while (condition) {
    // Code to be executed
}


Example:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int num = sc.nextInt();

while(num != 4) {
  System.out.println(num);
  num = sc.nextInt();
}
