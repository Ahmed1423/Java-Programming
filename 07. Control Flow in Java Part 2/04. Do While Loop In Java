The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, except that it guarantees at least one execution of the code block
because the condition is checked after the loop runs.


do {
    // Code to be executed
} while (condition);


Example:

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

int num;

do {
  num = sc.nextInt();
  System.out.println(num);
}while(num != 4);
