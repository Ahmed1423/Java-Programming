Streams API:

Streams API is used to process the collection of objects. A stream in Java is a sequence of objects that support various methods that can be pipelined to produce the final result.

Streams features:

1. Stream is not a data structure, it just reads input from collections, IO etc. 
2. Stream does not modify the original collection, it just produces the result.
3. Intermediate operations returns another streams, so they can chained. 
4. Terminal operations end the stream and return the result.

Types of Operations:

1. Intermediate Operations
2. Terminal Operations 

Benefit of Java Stream:

There are some benefits because of which we use Stream in Java as mentioned below:

- No Storage
- Pipeline of Functions
- Laziness
- Can be infinite
- Can be parallelized
- Can be created from collections, arrays, Files Lines, Methods in Stream, IntStream etc.
- Real-World Use Cases of Java Streams

Streams are widely used in modern Java applications for:

- Data Processing
- For processing JSON/XML responses
- For database Operations
- Concurrent Processing
