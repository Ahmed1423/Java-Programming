Method overloading is a powerful feature in Java that lets you define multiple methods with the same name in
a class, as long as their parameter lists are different.

Purpose of Method Overloading

âœ… Improves readability: You donâ€™t need to invent new method names for similar operations.
ðŸ”„ Supports polymorphism: Specifically, compile-time polymorphism (also called static polymorphism).
ðŸ§  Makes code intuitive: One method name can handle different types or numbers of inputs.
