🛠️ What Are Methods in Java?
A method in Java is a block of code that performs a specific task. Think of it like a mini-program inside your program.

🔑 Key Components of a Method:
Access modifier: Controls visibility (e.g., public, private)
Return type: What the method gives back (int, String, or void if nothing)
Method name: Follows camelCase naming (e.g., calculateSum)
Parameters: Optional inputs the method can use
Method body: The actual code that runs

🎯 What’s the Purpose of Methods?
Methods are the building blocks of clean, efficient, and maintainable Java code. Here's why they matter:

✅ Reusability: Write once, use many times—no need to repeat code
👓 Readability: Named methods make code easier to understand
🛠️ Maintainability: Easier to fix bugs or update logic
🧪 Testability: You can test methods independently
