🔁 Call by Value

Definition: A copy of the actual value is passed to the method.
Effect: Changes made inside the method do not affect the original variable.
Used for: Primitive types like int, float, char, etc.

🔗 Call by Reference

Definition: A reference (memory address) to the original variable is passed.
Effect: Changes made inside the method do affect the original variable.
Used in languages like: C++ (with pointers), Python (with mutable objects)

🧩 What Does Java Use?

Java is strictly call by value—but with a twist when it comes to objects:
✅ Primitive types: Passed by value (no surprises here)
✅ Objects: The reference to the object is passed by value

So while Java doesn’t support true call by reference, it copies the reference, meaning:

You can modify the object’s internal state
But you can’t reassign the reference to point to a new object and expect the caller to see that change
