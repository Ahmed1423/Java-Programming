Exception handling in Java:

Exception handling is a mechanism in Java that helps us to handle the runtime exceptions so that the program can continue with its desired flow.

Exception hierarchy:

Throwable 

	Exception
		User Defined Exception
		Built in Exception
			Checked Exception
			Unchecked Exception 
	Error

Exception: Runtime Error that causes the program to deviate from the desired flow.

Error: Serious problem in code that a regular application shouldn't try to handle. Example: StackOverFlowError, OutOfMemoryError

Checked Exception: Checked exceptions are also called as compile time exceptions because they are handled by the compiler during the compilation time. Example: ClassNotFoundException, FileNotFoundException, IOException, SQLException

Unchecked Exception: Unchecked exceptions are runtime exceptions that do not occur at the compile time but occur at the runtime. Example: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
