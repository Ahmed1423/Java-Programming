Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.

The table below shows the primitive type and the equivalent wrapper class:

Primitive Data Type	Wrapper Class
byte	              Byte
short	              Short
int	                Integer
long	              Long
float	              Float
double	            Double
boolean	            Boolean
char	              Character

1. Autoboxing
The automatic conversion of primitive types to the object of their corresponding wrapper classes is known as autoboxing.

2. Unboxing
It is just the reverse process of autoboxing. Automatically converting an object of a wrapper class to its corresponding primitive type is known as unboxing
