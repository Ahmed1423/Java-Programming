Positive numbers are represented in normal way, convert to 0's and 1's. 
Negative numbers are represented in 2's complement.

1's complement is invert all bits. 
2's complement is 1's complement + 1.

Last bit indicates sign (0 -> +ve, 1 -> -ve)

Bitwise negation: 

+ve -> invert all bits 
-ve -> invert all bits(2's complement)

formula: -x-1.
