🔍 What Is var in Java?
var lets the compiler infer the type of a local variable from its initializer.

It’s not a keyword in the traditional sense — it’s a reserved type name.

Improves readability and reduces boilerplate, especially with generics.

Rules:

- Must be initialized
- only for local variables
- type is inferred at compile time
- works with generics
