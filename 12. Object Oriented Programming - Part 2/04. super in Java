The super keyword in Java is a powerful tool used to refer to the immediate parent class of a subclass.
It helps in accessing parent class members (fields, methods, constructors) that are hidden or overridden in the
child class.

1. Access Parent Class Methods
2. Access Parent Class Fields
3. Call Parent Class Constructor

super() must be the first statement in the constructor.
super works only with instance members and not static.
using super to access private members is not allowed.
