Inheritance in Java allows one class to acquire the properties and behaviour of another class having parent child relationship.

private members of a parent class are not inherited and cannot be accessed directly by sub class.
super class -> base class
sub class -> child class

Inheritance provides

- code reusability
- prerequisite for method overriding

Types of Inheritance:

i) Simple  A <- B
ii) Multilevel A <- B <- C
iii) Hierarchial  A <- B, c
iv) multiple - only achieved through interfaces and not with classes. A, B <- C
v) hybrid - combination of one or more inheritances.

IS-A represents an inheritance relationship in Java, meaning this object is a type of that object.
