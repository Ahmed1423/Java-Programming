Encapsulation in Java:

Encapsulation is one of the pillars of object oriented programming that binds the data and the behaviour that acts upon these data into a single unit called as class.

Goal of Encapsulation to hide the internal state and the implementation.

We can achieve Encapsulation in Java is 

1) By making the feels as private 
2) By having public getters and setters

Mechanism is access modifiers.

Benefits:

Security: prevents unauthorized access to internal data. 
Flexibility: Implementation can change without affecting external code.
Reusability: Encapsulated classes are more modular and reusable.

Real World Analogy: Capsule. Medicine is inside of it, we cannot see or touch it. We can only consume the capsule.

Example: 

class Person {

  private String name;
  private int age;

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public int getAge() {
    return age;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {

    if(name != null) {
      this.name = name;
    } else {
      this.name = "";
    }
  }

  public void setAge(int age) {
    this.age = age;
  }

}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person pers = new Person();

    pers.setName("Ahmed");
    pers.setAge(24);

    System.out.println(pers.getName());
    System.out.println(pers.getAge());
  }
}
