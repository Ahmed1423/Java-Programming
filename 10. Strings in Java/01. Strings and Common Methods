Strings in Java: 

Strings are Objects in Java that stores sequence of characters. Every character occupies 2 bytes of memory.

Strings are immutable in Java, meaning once object is created it cannot be modified.

There are two ways of creating string:

01. String literal: 

String name = "Ahmed";

02. Using new keyword: 

String name = new String("Ahmed");



String literals are stored in string constant pool area in the heap memory. 
Strings created with new keyword are present in heap memory outside of string constant pool. 

Common Methods: 

01. length()
02. toLowerCase()
03. toUpperCase()
04. contains()
05. equals()
06. substring()
