An Object is an instance of a class. It is a real world entity. It consists of three things: 

1. state: represents attributes (or) properties of an object. 
2. behavior: represents methods (or) behaviors of an object. 
3. identity: Every object has its own unique name, which allows objects to communicate with each other. 

The new operator instantiates a class by allocating memory for a new object and returning a reference to that memory.

There are four ways of creating an object: 

1. Using new keyword: 

Person person = new Person();

2. Reflection (dynamic class loading): 

Class<?> s = Class.forName("Person");
Person person = (Person) s.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();

3. clone method 

Test t = new Test();
Test t1 = (Test) t.clone();

4. Deserialization.
