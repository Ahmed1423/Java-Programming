this keyword refers to the current instance (or) object. 

Main purpose is to differentiate between the instance variables and local variables. 

class Person {
  String name; 
  int age;

  Person(String name, int age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
}


this usecases: 

- differentiate between local and instance variables. 
- return the current instance
- pass the current instance
- call the method using the current instance
- invoke current class constructor etc
