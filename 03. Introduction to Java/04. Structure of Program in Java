There is one method that is mandatory, which is main method. 

Main method is the entry point of the program i.e. where the execution of the program starts. 
JVM is responsible for invoking the main method. When we run the program JVM looks for the main method and invokes it 
directly without creating an object of the class as it is a static method.
