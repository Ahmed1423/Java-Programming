A data type defines the kind of data a variable can hold. Variables are like containers, but not all containers can hold every type of data.
Each type of data needs a specific kind of container—this is where data types come in.

Examples:

- Whole numbers → int
- Large numbers → long
- True/False values → boolean
- Single characters → char

Categories of Data Types in Java:

Java has two main categories of data types:

    1.Primitive Data Types Used to store simple values. These types store the actual value in memory.

      Java provides 8 primitive types:

      byte → 1 byte
      short → 2 bytes
      int → 4 bytes
      long → 8 bytes
      float → 4 bytes
      double → 8 bytes
      char → 2 bytes (uses Unicode character set)
      boolean → 1 bit (true or false)

    2.Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types Used to store complex values. These types store a reference (memory address) pointing to the location
      of the object in memory, rather than the actual value.

      Examples include:

      String
      Class
      Interface 
      Enum
      Collections (e.g., List, Set, Map)
