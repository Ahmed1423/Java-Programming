Constants in Java are nothing but variables whose value cannot be changed once assigned. 

Example: x = 10;

In order to make this a constant:

final int x = 10;

x = 5 // gives an error.


Constants are generally written in CAPS with _ as separation

Example: final String NAME = "Ahmed";
         final String FIRST_NAME = "Mohammed";
