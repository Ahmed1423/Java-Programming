In order to read input from console: 

We can use scanner object.

Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);


int number = scanner.nextInt();
String value = scanner.next() (or) scanner.nextLine();
boolean isFalse = scanner.nextBoolean();
float num = scanner.nextFloat();
double pi = scanner.nextDouble();
Byte b = scanner.nextByte();
Short s = scanner.nextShort();
long digit = scanner.nextLong();

scanner.close(); // Good practice to close scanner once you are done with your work. 

In order to write output to console: 

System.out.println("Hello, Ahmed!"); // prints and moves to new line
System.out.print("Hello, Ahmed!"); // prints and continues in the same line.
