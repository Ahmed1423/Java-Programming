Comments are non-executable lines in code that help explain what the code is doing.
They make your program easier to understand and maintain.

Java supports three types of comments:

1) Single-line Comments

    Used for brief explanations or notes.
    Begin with //
    Everything after // on that line is ignored by the compiler.

2) Multi-line Comments

    Used for longer explanations that span multiple lines.
    Begin with /* and end with */
    Everything between /* and */ is ignored by the compiler.

3) Documentation Comments

    Used to generate external documentation using the javadoc tool.
    Begin with /** and end with */
    Often placed above classes, methods, or fields to describe their purpose.
