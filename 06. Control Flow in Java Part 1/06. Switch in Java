int number = 4;

switch(num % 2) {
  case 1: System.out.println("Odd");
          break;
  case 0: System.out.println("Even");
          break;
  default: System.out.println("What is this number man?");
}


default statement is optional, but good to have as in case if any case doesn't get executed, default case will. 
fall through behaviour will happen if we don't keep break statement for cases. 

Switch Expressions can return the values as well.

int d = 3;
String day = switch(d) {
  case 1 -> "Monday";
  case 7 -> "Sunday";
  default -> "Some Random day of the Week Given";
}

Switch only works with byte, short, int, char, Byte, Short, Integer, Character, Strings and enum
Switch doesn't support float, boolean and double
