Increment and Decrement Operators are unary operators i.e they work on single operand. They help us in incrementing
and decrementing value by 1. 

1. pre increment & post increment
2. pre decrement & post decrement
3. unary plus 
4. unary minus

Pre increment operator: 

int num = 0; 

int num1 = ++num --> first num is incremented and then assigned to num1 

// num1 = 1, num = 1

Pre Decrement Operator:

int num = 0; 

int num1 = --num --> first num is decremented and then assigned to num1 

// num1 = -1, num = -1

Post increment operator: 

int num = 0; 

int num1 = num++ --> first num is assigned to num1 and then incremented

// num1 = 0, num = 1

Post decrement operator: 

int num = 0; 

int num1 = num-- --> first num is assigned to num1 and then decremented 

// num1 = 0, num = -1


Unary plus: indicates a positive value(often redundant)

int num = +2;

Unary minus: negates the value of operand

int num = -3;
