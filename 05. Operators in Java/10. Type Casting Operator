Type casting is used to convert one type into another, either implicitly (automatic) or explicitly (manual).

    Implicit casting (Widening): Java automatically converts smaller data types to larger data types.
        Example: int a = 5; double b = a; // Implicit casting

    Explicit casting (Narrowing): You manually cast a larger data type to a smaller one.
        Example: double d = 9.78; int i = (int) d; // i becomes 9
