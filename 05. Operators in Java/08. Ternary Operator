?: is the ternary operator. 

Syntax:

(expression) ? executes this statement if true : executes this statement if false. 

int num = 2;

(num % 2 == 0) ? System.out.println("even") : System.out.println("odd");

since expression is true, even is printed.

(num * 4 == 6) ? System.out.println("correct") : System.out.println("wrong");

since expression is false, wrong is printed.
