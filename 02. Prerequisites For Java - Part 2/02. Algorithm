Algorithm: 

An Algorithm is a sequence of instructions that solves a well defined problem. There are many types of 
algorithms such as:

- Recursive Algorithm: Solves a problem by calling itself with smaller inputs, and it terminates when it reaches a base case.
- Backtracking Algorithm: Solves problems by exploring all possible solutions and undoing the decisions (backtracking) when a path does not lead to a solution.
- Dynamic Programming: Breaks down a problem into smaller overlapping subproblems, solving each once and storing the results to avoid redundant work.
- Divide and Conquer: Divides a problem into smaller sub-problems, solves each one, and then combines the results to get the final solution.

Example of an Algorithm to add two numbers:

1) Start
2) Read num1
3) Read num2 
3) Add num1 and num2 and store it in num3
4) display num3
5) Stop
