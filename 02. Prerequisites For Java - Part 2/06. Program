Program: 

A program is a sequence of instructions that tells a computer how to perform a specific task. Programs can range from simple
operations (like adding two numbers) to complex systems (like operating systems or web servers).

programming: 

The process of coming up with those instructions is called as programming. It involves writing, testing, debugging, and 
maintaining code to ensure the program performs as expected.

Key stages of programming:

a) planning and design 
b) development 
c) testing and debugging
d) deployment 
e) maintenance

programming language: 

Programs are written with the help of programming languages. They provide an interface between computers and humans by enabling us 
to write instructions that is easier compared to machine code. Every programming language will have its own syntax that needs to be followed while writing the programs. 

Examples: Java, Python, C++, C 

Syntax: Set of rules that define the structure of language.
