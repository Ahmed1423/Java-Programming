Compiler: 

1) Converts the entire high-level code into machine code in one go.
2) A separate executable file is created.
3) Gives list of all syntax errors once the entire program is processed.
4) Source code is private and not required after compilation.
5) Faster execution.

Interpreter:

1) Converts high level code into machine code line by line and executes simultaneously. 
2) No separate executable file is created.
3) Execution stops when the first error is encountered, preventing the program from running further.
4) Source code is not private as it is required every time we want to execute the code.
5) slower execution.
