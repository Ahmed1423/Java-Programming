Computer languages are categorized into two types:

1)  Low-Level Languages:
    These languages are closer to machine code, making them easier for machines to understand but harder for humans. There are two types of low-level languages:

    a) Machine Language:
    This language consists of binary code (1's and 0's) that the computer can directly understand without any translation. No transformer tool is needed.

    b) Assembly Language:
    This language uses special codes, called mnemonics, to represent instructions. Since assembly language is not in binary code, it requires a tool (an assembler) to translate it into machine language.

    Assembler: A tool that converts assembly language into machine language.

2)  High-Level Languages:
    These languages are easier for humans to understand but difficult for machines. High-level languages need to be translated into machine code for the computer to execute.
    This translation is done using tools like compilers or interpreters.
    There are different categories of high-level languages, including compiled, interpreted, and hybrid languages.

    a) Compiled level language: uses a compiler to convert the high level code to machine level code.
    b) Interpreted level language: uses an interpreter to convert the high level code to machine code.
    c) Hybrid level languages: uses both interpreter and compiler to convert the high level code into machine code
