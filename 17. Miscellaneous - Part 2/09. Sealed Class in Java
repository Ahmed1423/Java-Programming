sealed class is a technique that limits the number of classes that can inherit the given class. 
This means that only the classes designated by the programmer can inherit from that particular class, thereby restricting access to it.

Steps to Create a Sealed Class:

- Define the class that you want to make a seal.
- Add the "sealed" keyword to the class and specify which classes are permitted to inherit it by using the "permits" keyword.

Every subclass of a sealed class or interface must be declared as one of:

final → cannot be extended further.

sealed → continues the restriction with its own permits.

non-sealed → lifts the restriction, allowing open inheritance.

public sealed class Shape permits Circle, Square, Triangle {
    // common logic
}

final class Circle extends Shape { }
non-sealed class Square extends Shape { }
sealed class Triangle extends Shape permits Equilateral { }

final class Equilateral extends Triangle { }
