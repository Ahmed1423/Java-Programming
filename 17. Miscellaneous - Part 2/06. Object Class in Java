ðŸ§  What is Object in Java?

The root superclass of all Java classes.
Every class implicitly extends Object unless it explicitly extends another class.
Provides default behavior that all objects inherit.

ðŸ”§ Key Methods in Object Class:

toString():	Returns string representation of the object. format: className@HexadecimalHashCode
hashCode(): JVM generates a unique number called hashcode for every object. It is not internal address of object. 
           Internal address of object is passed through an algorithm to give us the hash code. 
equals(): compares passed object with the current object. If we override equals method, we must override hashcode as well.
          Contract: Equal Objects must have equal hashcodes.
finalize(): called before the garbage collector is run for clean up of the resources. 
getClass(): returns a class object of this object. 
clone(): creates and returns a copy of the object.

wait(), notify() and notifyAll() are some other methods.
