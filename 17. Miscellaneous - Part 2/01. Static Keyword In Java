Static Keyword in Java is mainly used for memory management, allowing variables and methods to be bound to class
rather than the instance itself.

Static uses:

1. Variable 
2. Method 
3. Block
4. Inner class

Characteristics of static keyword:

1. static members are bound to class, not the instance.
2. memory is allocated only once when program runs, not for every object. 
3. static members cannot access non static members.
4. They are accessed by the class name.
5. static methods cannot be overriden by subclasses, since it is bound to class and not object. 

Static Variables: created only once and shared among all instances. 
Static block: executed only once when the class is loaded. Used when we want to do any computation to initialize
              static variables. Run before the constructor.
Static methods: bound to class, not object. Can access static members only. Cannot refer to this (or) super in any way.
Static class: A class can be static only if it's a nested class. If a nested class is static, we need not create reference
              of outer class.  

class Counter {
    
    static int counter;
    
    static {
        counter = 0;
    }
    
    Counter() {
        counter += 1;
    }
    
    static int getCount() {
        return counter;
    }
}


class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Counter obj1 = new Counter();
        Counter obj2 = new Counter();
        
        System.out.println(Counter.getCount());
    }
}
