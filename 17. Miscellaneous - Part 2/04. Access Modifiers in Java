Access modifiers helps us in controlling access for variables, methods, classes.

There are four types of access modifiers:

1. public : can be accessed from anywhere
2. default: can be accessed within the same package
3. protected: can be accessed by same class (or) subclasses in/out of package.
4. private: can be accessed by same class where they are declared.
